					a01: OS & Unix Intro
	1.	[5] An abstract model of a computer has 5 components. What are they, and what do they do?

		Input (input data device/mechanism), CPU (The central processing unit what it manage the control the machine and a Logical unit to perform operations), Main Memory (Memory to store instructions and data), Secondary Memory (External Mass storage), Output (A device/mechanism to print or display results or any feedback we want from the operation)

	2.	[5] Briefly describe the 5 types of CPU operations.

		Fetch (retrieving an instruction from program memory), Decode (converting the instruction into signals that control other parts of the CPU, machine language), Execute (perform a single or multiple sequence of actions), Memory Access (writing information in memory or reading information from memory), Writeback (storage method involving writing data into the cache memory whenever a change happens and written into the main memory only every once in a while or under certain constraints).

	3.	[2] What are the 2 Roles of the OS?

		Manages the hardware and software resources into the system and also provides a platform for applications to deal with the hardware (abstraction).

	4.	[4] What are the OS's tasks?

		Process management, Memory Management, File System Management, Device Management.

	5.	[1] What is a process?

		A process is an instance of a program.

	6.	[1] What is scheduling?

		Determine which process is given control of the CPU.

	7.	[1] What allows the OS to execute commands with more privileges than applications?

		Since is in management of processes, memory, file systems and devices its provided with the Kernel or Supervisor mode (Multimode Execution, ring 0)

	8.	[1] In what mode do applications/shell/libraries run?

		They run over User mode (ring 3). Some of the user applications with special permissions are granted the ring 2 called Hypervisor.


	9.	[1] How do user applications or libraries access the services offered by the OS?

		They perform a System Call (a privileged instruction) who generates a Trap, causes a Context Switch from User Mode to Kernel Mode and Executes the OSâ€™s trap handler, resulting on a desired action.


	10.	[1] How does an external device signal the OS when it has data to be processed?

	Asynchronously through an Interrupt.

	11.	[1] What device generates a Page Fault?

	Computer hardware, in particular Virtual Memory.

	12.	[1] What does a Page Fault indicate?

		Usually suggests that an memory increase is necessary to run a program through a minor, major or invalid fault.

	13.	[1] Why was/is Unix so portable?

		Written in a high-level language, providing a multiple user with multiple processes platform at the same time, sharing resources in an efficient and fair manner.

	14.	[2] What two methods (other than files on disk) can applications on the same machine use to communicate with one another?

		Pipe and Sockets.

	15.	[2] What are the differences between those two methods?

		Pipe offers One-way data channel on the same machine while Two-way data channel allows processes on the same or different machine to talk.

	16.	[5] Name the parts of a UNIX system?

		Kernel, System Calls, Shell, Library routine and Applications.

	17.	[3] Describe the Unix design philosophy.

		A program should do 1 thing fairly well. Whenever it comes to complex tasks it should be performed by using single utilities altogether.

	18.	[7] List the 4+3 types of files in UNIX, and give their symbol that represents them as from ls -l

		Regular / Ordinary / Normal / Data files (-)
		Directories (d)
		Devices (c, d)
		Links (l)
		Named Pipe ( p )
		Socket (s)
		Door (D)

	19.	[3] Give three places to look for more info about shell commands.
